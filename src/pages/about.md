  Artorias Devlog is a personal space where I share my journey through the worlds of programming, gaming, and game development. Here, you'll find insights into the projects I'm working on, as well as reflections on the lessons I’ve learned—and the ones I’m still discovering. This blog is also a place for me to share my thoughts, experiences, and musings about life itself. Whether you’re interested in game dev, coding, learning new skills, or just looking for a fresh perspective, I hope you’ll find something valuable here.
